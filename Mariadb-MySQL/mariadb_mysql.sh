# Pre- and post-snapshot execution hooks for MariaDB and MySQL with NetApp Astra Control.
# Tested with MySQL 8.0.29 (deployed by Bitnami helm chart 9.1.7)/MariaDB 10.6.8 (deployed by Bitnami helm chart 11.0.13) and NetApp Astra Control Service 22.04.
#
# args: [pre|post]
# pre: Flush all tables with read lock
# post: Take database out of read-only mode
#

# Complex shell commands are difficult to get right through a remote execution api.
# For something like this obtuse procedure, an alternative approach is to mount a
# script into the container.

# To quiesce and hold mariadb/mysql databases we need to iterate over each one
# and open a client connection to it, then issue a 'flush tables with read lock'
# and then sleep, holding the connection open indefinitely.  When the snapshot
# is done, the read lock is released by terminating the mysql process (from
# outside this script)

# DB variants & config vars:
#
# It does not matter significantly if we are using Maria or MySQL, but in general the assumption
# is that if any of the relevant environment variables starting with 'MARIADB' are set, we're
# dealing with Maria and we should prefer those variables over the mysql versions.

# writing don't know of anything else vaguely standard in the container world.
